If you have a background image and you inspect your body, you might see that your body ends before the end of the page. Therefore, when you do background-size: cover, and background-position: center, 
it is really only taking into account the small body. What we can do, is give the html height 100% so it takes up the entire container of the site. This will also prevent the image from tiling if you resize the picture, as it is taking up the entire html page.
